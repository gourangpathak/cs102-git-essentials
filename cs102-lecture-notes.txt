git add -> to stage files
git log -> to view commit history
git push -> to push local commits/changes to the remote repository
git clone -> to clone a remote repository into your local machine
git pull -> to pull commits/changes from remote repository

In these Lectures so far we have learnt about how to use Git & Github 
Git & Github are Version Control System and are very useful to 
keep a track of changes we make in our files, git follows a 2 stage
system i.e. staging and then commiting our code, We learned a few
basic commands in git, we learned how to initialize a remote repo,
pull/push changes between local repo and the remote repo, we also
learned about how versioning works and why it is so important, 
We have also learned how to use Github Desktop, and how to clone
repositories from Github Desktop, after this we moved on to setting
up the Visual Studio Code Environment, and tried our hands on the 
markdown language, markdown is a lightweight markup language for 
creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. We also installed
a markdown visualizing extension in VS Code for this purpose
